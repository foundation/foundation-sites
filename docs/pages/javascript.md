## Installing

You can get the Foundation JavaScript files from a ZIP download, package manager, or CDN. Check out the [Installation](installation.html) page to learn more.

Once you have the files, add links to jQuery and Foundation as `<script>` tags at the bottom of your page, just before the closing `<body>` tag.

```html
<script src="js/jquery.min.js"></script>
<script src="js/foundation.min.js"></script>
```

<div class="callout warning">
  <p>Make sure Foundation loads <em>after</em> jQuery.</p>
</div>

### File Structure

All of Foundation's plugins ship as individual files, named `foundation.tabs.js`, `foundation.accordion.js`, and so on. These files are also combined into one big file called `foundation.js`, which allows you to get every plugin at once.

If you're only using certain plugins, know that they all require `foundation.core.js` to be loaded *first*. Some plugins also require specific utility libraries that ship with Foundation&mdash;refer to a plugin's documentation to find out which plugins require what, and see the [JavaScript Utilities](javascript-utilities.html) page for more information.

```html
<!-- Example of selectively including files -->
<script src="js/jquery.min.js"></script>
<script src="js/foundation.core.js"></script>
<script src="js/foundation.tabs.js"></script>
<script src="js/foundation.accordion.js"></script>
```

<div class="callout warning">
  <p>Loading many individual files like this creates a lot of network overhead, especially for users on mobile networks. To keep your pages loading quick, we recommend using a tool like <a href="http://gruntjs.com">Grunt</a> or <a href="http://gulpjs.com">Gulp</a> to combine all of your JavaScript files into one.</p>
</div>

## Initializing

The `.foundation()` function on the jQuery object will kick off every Foundation plugin at once.

```js
$(document).foundation();
```

---

## Using Plugins

Plugins are attached to HTML elements using data attributes. The data attribute will match the name of the plugin. For example, adding `data-accordion` to an element creates an accordion, while adding `data-tooltip` creates a tooltip link.

```html_example
<p><span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" tabindex="1" title="Fancy word for a beetle.">Scarabaeus</span></p>
```

<div class="callout warning">
  <p>A single element can only have one Foundation plugin on it at a time. However, most plugins can be nested inside other ones.</p>
</div>

---

## Configuring Plugins

Each plugin has a set of configuration settings that customize how it works. For example, you change how fast an [accordion](accordion.html) slides up and down, or if [tooltips](tooltip.html) should appear on touch devices.

Plugin settings can be changed globally by changing the `DEFAULTS` property on the plugin.

```js
Foundation.Accordion.defaults.slideSpeed = 500;
Foundation.Accordion.defaults.multiExpand = true;
```

An individual instance of a plugin can also have different settings. These can be set in the HTML or in JavaScript.

In the HTML, each setting can be defined as an individual data attribute. Note that camelCased options are converted to hyphenated words. In the below example, `multiExpand` becomes `data-multi-expand`.

```html
<div data-accordion data-slide-speed="500" data-multi-expand="true"></div>
```

---

## Adding Plugins After Page Load

If you add new HTML to the DOM, any plugins on those elements won't be initialized by default. Re-call the `.foundation()` function to check for new plugins.

```js
$.ajax('assets/partials/kitten-carousel.html', function(data) {
  $('#kitten-carousel').html(data).foundation();
});
```

---

## Programmatic Use

Plugins can be created programmatically in JavaScript. Every plugin is a class on the global `Foundation` object, with a constructor that accepts two parameters: an element to attach to, and an object of options.

```js
var $accordion = new Foundation.Accordion($('#accordion'), {
  slideSpeed: 500,
  multiExpand: true
});
```

Most plugins have a public API that allows you to manipulate it through JavaScript. Refer to a plugin's documentation to learn what functions are available. Invoking methods is easy as pie:

```js
$('#reveal').foundation('open'); //will open a Reveal modal with id `reveal`.

$('[data-tabs]').eq(0).foundation('selectTab', $('#example')); //will change the first Tabs on the page to whatever panel you choose.

$('.tooltip').foundation('destroy'); //will destroy all Tooltips on the page.

```
You can use any jQuery selector you like, and if the selector encompasses multiple plugins, they will all have the same the chosen method invoked. You pass arguments just like you would any in other JavaScript `function(comma, delimited, so, easy)`. We did make an effort to reduce the number of public methods that require arguments, but check the plugin's page to see if it requires additional information.

<div class="callout warning">
  <p>Plugin methods prefixed with an underscore are considered part of the internal API, which means they could change, break, or disappear without warning. We recommend sticking to only the public API, which is documented on each plugin's page.</p>
</div>

---

## Events

Every plugin fires DOM events when certain functions finish. For example, you can listen for when tabs change, or an off-canvas menu opens, and create a callback to respond to it.

```js
$('[data-tabs]').on('change.zf.tabs', function() {
  console.log('Those tabs sure did change!');
});
```

Refer to each plugin's documentation to see a list of events it fires, and when they fire.

<div class="callout warning">
  <p>Starting with Foundation 6, we removed callbacks as plugin settings. All use of callbacks with plugins should be done as event listeners.</p>
</div>
