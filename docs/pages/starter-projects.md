Our project templates give you a solid... *Foundation* on which to start a new project. Both templates use the [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com) build system to automate the process of compiling Sass, processing JavaScript, copying files, and more.

## Basic Template

<div class="responsive-embed widescreen mb1">

  <a id="docs-mobile-video-link" class="docs-mobile-video" target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/ofSZUKkjPRY"></a>
</div>

Our basic project template is a lot like the Sass template from Foundation 5. The project has a flat directory structure and only compiles Sass. It's great if you want to quickly put together a simple project and only need to use Sass.

<!--
You can set up a basic project through the Foundation CLI with this command:

```bash
foundation new --framework sites --template basic
```
-->

You can manually install the template with:
 ```bash
# Download the template with Git
git clone https://github.com/foundation/foundation-sites-template projectname

# Move to the project folder, and install dependencies
cd projectname
yarn

# Build the Sass files
yarn start
```

Your project will be recompiled every time you save a Sass file in `dist/.

## ZURB Template

</div>

The official ZURB Template includes not only Sass processing, but also JavaScript processing, Handlebars templating, and image compression. We use this exact template at ZURB for our client work!

<!--
You can set up an advanced project through the Foundation CLI with this command:

```bash
foundation new --framework sites --template zurb
```
-->

You can manually install the template with:
```bash
# Download the ZURB template with Git
git clone https://github.com/foundation/foundation-zurb-template projectname

# Move to the project folder, and install dependencies
cd projectname
yarn

# Build the project
yarn start
```

Once compiled, you project is viewable at: <a class="button primary" href="http://localhost:8000" target="_blank">http://localhost:8000</a>

The biggest difference between this and the basic template is the folder structure. In the ZURB Template, your project has a `src/` folder which contains your source files, and a separate `dist/` folder with your finished website. As you work on your project, Gulp continuously updates your `dist/` folder with new versions of files. To compile a production build, run `yarn build`.

To override or add to the default styles of the ZURB Template, in your project's `src/assets/scss/` folder
 - Change Sass variables in `_settings.scss`
 - Add custom SCSS and css to new files in the `components` folder then import those files at the bottom of `app.scss`

The `_settings.scss` and `app.scss` files are not changed when upgrading an existing project. As a result, you must manually edit your `_settings.scss` file to incorporate any Sass changes found [in the release notes](https://github.com/foundation/foundation-sites/releases).

### Features

Here's an overview of what the ZURB Template can do:

* **Asset Copying**

  Gulp will copy anything out of the `src/assets` folder as-is to the `assets` folder of your final project. Note that Sass files, JavaScript files, and images are *not* **part of this copying process, as they have their own steps.**


* **Page Compilation**

  The `src/` directory includes three folders used to create HTML pages: `pages/`, `layouts/`, and `partials/`. A flat file compiler called [Panini](panini.html) is used to process your project's various pages, inserting them into a common template, and injecting any HTML partials. This is done with a templating language called [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/).

  Panini has a dedicated page here in the docs that explains its various features. **[Learn more about Panini.](panini.html)**

* **Sass Compilation**

  Sass is compiled to CSS using [Libsass](https://sass-lang.com/libsass) (via [node-sass](https://github.com/sass/node-sass)). The main Sass file is under `src/assets/scss/app.scss`, and imports Foundation and Motion UI. Any new Sass partials you create should be in this folder as well.

  The CSS is output in the `nested` style, which is readable like normal CSS. A source map is also created, which can be read by developer tools such as the Chrome Web Inspector. When building for production, the CSS is also compressed with [clean-css](https://github.com/jakubpawlowicz/clean-css/issues), and pruned with [UnCSS](https://github.com/giakki/uncss). UnCSS scans the HTML of your pages and removes any CSS classes you didn't use.

* **JavaScript Compilation**

  JavaScript is transpiled using [Babel](https://babeljs.io) (with the [es2015 plugin](https://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/#es2015)) so you can use [ES2015 features](https://babeljs.io/learn-es2015/).
  The main Js file is under `src/assets/js/app.js`, and imports Foundation, jQuery and whatInput. You can import there installed packages and custom files, they will be included in the build.

  A source map is created that maps back to the original files. By default, the bundled `app.js` is uncompressed. When building for production, the file is run through [UglifyJS](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS) for compression.

  The whole bundling process is handled by [webpack](https://webpack.js.org): it manages all assets and dependencies for you and compiles them into one single file. If you're unfamiliar with imports or module bundling, check out:

  * [Beginner’s guide to JavaScript Modules](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/javascript-modules-a-beginner-s-guide-783f7d7a5fcc).

* **Image Compression**

  By default, all images are copied as-is from `assets/img` to your `dist` folder. When building for production, images are run through [gulp-imagemin](https://github.com/sindresorhus/gulp-imagemin) for compression. The plugin supports JPEG, PNG, SVG, and GIF files.

* **BrowserSync**

  The template creates a [BrowserSync](https://www.browsersync.io/) server, which is at `http://localhost:8000`. Load this URL to see your compiled templates. While the server is running, any time you save a file, any pages you have open will automatically refresh, allowing you to see changes in real-time as you work.

* **Style Guide Creation**

  Under `src/styleguide` are two files to create a style guide for your project. The style guide is generated using Style Sherpa, a small plugin created by ZURB.

Style Sherpa has a dedicated page here in the docs that explains its various features. **[Learn more about Style Sherpa.](style-sherpa.html)**
