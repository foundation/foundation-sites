The folks at [cdnjs](https://cdnjs.com) host the compressed Foundation CSS and JavaScript for us. Just drop one of these `<script>` tags into your HTML and you're set:

```html
<!-- Compressed CSS -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/foundation/6.3.1/css/foundation.min.css" integrity="sha256-itWEYdFWzZPBG78bJOOiQIn06QCgN/F0wMDcC4nOhxY=" crossorigin="anonymous" />

<!-- MotionUI - used for component animations -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/motion-ui/1.2.2/motion-ui.min.css"/>

<!-- Compressed JavaScript -->
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/foundation/6.3.1/js/foundation.min.js" integrity="sha256-Nd2xznOkrE9HkrAMi4xWy/hXkQraXioBg9iYsBrcFrs=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
```

Example usage:

```html
<!doctype html>
<html class="no-js" lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <meta http-equiv="x-ua-compatible" content="ie=edge">

    <script>
      $(document).foundation();
    </script>

## Command-Line Tool

<div class="responsive-embed widescreen mb1">
  <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rQguHjGzFEw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
  <a id="docs-mobile-video-link" class="docs-mobile-video" target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/rQguHjGzFEw"></a>
</div>

This is the recommended way to create ready-to-go Foundation Sass projects. The CLI (Command Line Interface) is an easy to install, tiny app that allows you to create and update Foundation Sass projects.

What is needed?

- [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/) (Version 4 - 6.10.3)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- Bower (CLI will install for you)
- Gulp (CLI will install for you)

The CLI and the ZURB Stack are both Node.JS based and required to run these modern build tools. Bower is a package manager for the web, which lets you download and install front-end libraries via the command line. For example, installing jQuery is a one line command: bower install jquery.

As mentioned, Foundation CLI uses Gulp and Bower under the hood. In case you’re not familiar with Gulp and Bower, Gulp is a JavaScript task runner that will help you automate painful or time-consuming tasks in your development workflow. This includes SCSS compilation, minification, concatenation, image compression and other useful tasks.

**Step 1** - Install Node: To install the CLI, you must first download and install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (which includes npm). npm stands for [node packaged modules](https://www.npmjs.com/) and is the package manager for JavaScript and the world’s largest software registry.

**Step 2** - Then, from the command line (Terminal for Mac):

```bash
npm install --global foundation-cli
```

<div class="callout primary">
  <p>Depending on how your machine is configured, the command may fail with an <code>EACCESS</code> error. To get around this, run the command with <code>sudo</code> at the beginning:</p>
</div>

```bash
sudo npm install --global foundation-cli
```

**Step 3** - Once you've installed the CLI, use the `new` command to start making a new project:

```bash
foundation new
```

You have a choice to build the Advanced template (ZURB Stack) or Basic template using the CLI.

Choose your project type and name and the CLI will go to work for you building your Sass project. This will download all the packages needed to run the project. It could take a few minutes depending on your internet connection.

<p><img src="{{root}}assets/img/cli-start.png"></p>

That's it! The CLI will now build you a project that is ready to go!

You will see a message like this:
<p><img src="{{root}}assets/img/cli-complete.png"></p>

**Step 4** - Now you can `cd` (change directory) into your new project and run `npm start` to start the build system and begin creating your next project.

<a data-toggle="f5-cli">Already have the Foundation 5 CLI installed?</a>

<div style="display: none;" class="callout alert" id="f5-cli" data-toggler data-animate="fade-in fade-out">
  <p>If you already have the Foundation 5 CLI on your machine, you will only be able to access one of the commands, depending on how your command line environment is configured.</p>

  <p>If you want to remove the old CLI, run <code>gem uninstall foundation</code>. After testing this new CLI, if you want to go back to the old CLI, run <code>npm uninstall foundation-cli --global</code>.</p>
</div>

---

## Manual Setup

If you don’t want the Foundation CLI to build projects for you, you can manually download and install the Sass starter builds themselves.

<p>
  <a class="" data-open-video="6:04"><img src="{{root}}assets/img/icons/watch-video-icon.svg" class="video-icon" height="30" width="30" alt=""> Watch this part in video</a>
</p>

What is needed?

- [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/) (Version 0.12 - 6.10.3)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- Bower - `$ npm install -g bower`

### ZURB Template

The official ZURB Template includes not only Sass processing, but also JavaScript processing, Handlebars templating, and image compression. We use this exact template at ZURB for our client work!

To manually set up the ZURB template, first download it with Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zurb/foundation-zurb-template projectname
```

Then open the folder in your command line, and install the needed dependencies:

```bash
cd projectname
npm install
bower install
```

Finally, run `npm start` to run Gulp. Your finished site will be created in a folder called `dist`, viewable at this URL:

```
http://localhost:8000
```

To create compressed, production-ready assets, run `npm run build`.

<a href="starter-projects.html#zurb-template">Learn more about the ZURB Stack →</a>

### Basic Template

Our basic project template has a flat directory structure and only compiles Sass. It's great if you want to quickly put together a simple project and only need to use Sass or if you’re looking for a simple Sass Gulp automation.

To manually set up the basic template, first download it with Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zurb/foundation-sites-template projectname
```

Then open the folder in your command line, and install the needed dependencies:

```bash
cd projectname
npm install
bower install
```

Finally, run `npm start` to run the Sass compiler. It will re-run every time you save a Sass file.

## Package Managers

<p>
  <a class="" data-open-video="9:13"><img src="{{root}}assets/img/icons/watch-video-icon.svg" class="video-icon" height="30" width="30" alt=""> Watch this part in video</a>
</p>

Foundation is available on <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/" target="_blank">NPM</a>, <a href="https://bower.io/" target="_blank">Bower</a>, <a href="https://atmospherejs.com/" target="_blank">Meteor</a>, <a href="https://rubygems.org/" target="_blank">RubyGems</a>, <a href="https://getcomposer.org/" target="_blank">Composer</a> and <a href="https://www.nuget.org/" target="_blank">NuGet</a>. The package includes all of the source Sass and JavaScript files, as well as compiled CSS and JavaScript, in uncompressed and compressed flavors.

Install with a package manager gets you the compiled CSS and JS files as well as the source JavaScript, and Sass source files. If you're using Gulp, Grunt, or another task runner, you'll use this package to set up your project. You'll need to compile the Sass yourself.

There are two ways to do this. You can either add your dependency (the package) to your bower.json (Bower) or package.json (npm) file, or you can use the command line. To make things simple, you can use the command line:

<ul class="icon-list menu vertical">
  <li><img src="https://eg2.gallerycdn.vsassets.io/extensions/eg2/vscode-npm-script/0.1.9/1491853545308/Microsoft.VisualStudio.Services.Icons.Default" class="" height="" width="" alt=""><strong>npm:</strong> <code>npm install foundation-sites</code></li>
  <li><img src="https://bower.io/img/bower-logo.png" class="" height="" width="" alt=""><strong>Bower:</strong> <code>bower install foundation-sites</code></li>
  <li><img src="https://shmck.herokuapp.com/content/images/2015/07/meteor.png" class="" height="" width="" alt=""><strong>Meteor:</strong> <code>meteor add zurb:foundation-sites</code></li>
  <li><img src="https://getcomposer.org/img/logo-composer-transparent2.png" class="" height="" width="" alt=""><strong>Composer:</strong> <code>php composer.phar require zurb/foundation</code></li>
  <li><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/25/NuGet_project_logo.svg/220px-NuGet_project_logo.svg.png" class="" height="" width="" alt=""><strong>NuGet:</strong> <code>Install-Package foundation-sites</code></li>
  <li><img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/beede1ff8999a3d69c452f1cd0df90e076454344/687474703a2f2f7275627967656d732e6f72672f66617669636f6e2e69636f" class="" height="" width="" alt=""><strong>RubyGems:</strong> <code>gem install zurb-foundation</code></li>
</ul>

### Package Contents

Here's what comes in the package.

- `scss/`: Source Sass files. Use this folder as a load path in Sass.
- `js/`: Source JavaScript files. If you're using a build system, make sure `foundation.core.js` is loaded first.
- `dist/`: Compiled files.
  - `css/`: Compiled CSS files. Includes minified and unminified files.
  - `js/`: Concatenated JavaScript files. Includes minified and unminified files.
    - `plugins/`: Standalone JavaScript plugins.

Once installed with one of the above commands, Foundation has been downloaded via git and installed into the `assets/` directory.

If you are using Foundation Sass, you'll `@import` Foundation from the `scss/` folder. You will also link to the `js/` folder where all the uncompressed JS files live.

If you are using the compiled CSS and JS then you'll use the `css/` and `js/` files in the `dist/` folder.

## Yeoman Generator

A generator is basically a plugin that can be run with the `yo` command to scaffold complete projects or useful parts. There are many variations and combinations to build a Foundation project. Here are a couple:

- [Foundation + Browserify Project Generator](https://github.com/dougmacklin/generator-foundation-browserify)
- [Foundation 6 web app generator](https://github.com/bassjobsen/generator-foundation6/)

## Download The Sass Files

If you want to get the Sass files and use your own build system or workflow you can dowload the Sass source files and have it your way. This method requires a Sass compiler and some setup.

*Note: Foundation uses <a href="https://autoprefixer.github.io/" target="_blank">Autoprefixer</a> to deal with <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Vendor_Prefix" target="_blank">CSS vendor prefixes</a>. If you're compiling Foundation from its Sass source and not using our Gulpfile, you'll need to integrate Autoprefixer into your build process yourself.*
