## Yeti Launch

Yeti Launch is our Mac app for quickly spinning up blank projects for any of the three Foundation frameworks. If you're just getting started with Foundation, we recommend downloading Yeti Launch to get going right away.

### Command-Line Tool

Not a fan of GUIs? The Node-powered Foundation CLI can install the same template projects for you. Install it with npm:

```bash
npm install --global foundation-cli
```

<div class="callout alert">
  <p>If you already have the Foundation 5 CLI on your machine, you will only be able to access one of the commands, depending on how your command line environment is configured.</p>

  <p>If you want to remove the old CLI, run <code>gem uninstall foundation</code>. After testing this new CLI, if you want to go back to the old CLI, run <code>npm uninstall foundation-cli --global</code>.</p>
</div>

Once you've installed the CLI, use the `new` command to start making a new project:

```bash
foundation new
```

## CSS Download

If you aren't into Sass, we have a starter template with compiled CSS and JavaScript, as well as a starting `index.html` file for you to hack on. Just unzip and get coding!

## CDN Links

The folks at [jsDelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com) host the compressed Foundation CSS and JavaScript for us. Just drop one of these `<script>` tags into you're HTML and you're set:

```html
<!-- Compressed CSS -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/foundation/6.1.1/foundation.min.css">

<!-- Compressed JavaScript -->
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/foundation/6.1.1/foundation.min.js"></script>
```

## Package Managers

Foundation is available on npm, Bower, Meteor, and Composer. The package includes all of the source Sass and JavaScript files, as well as compiled CSS and JavaScript, in uncompressed and compressed flavors.

- npm: `npm install foundation-sites`
- Bower: `bower install foundation-sites`
- Meteor: `meteor add zurb:foundation-sites`
- Composer: `php composer.phar require zurb/foundation`

### Package Contents

Here's what comes in the package.

- `scss/`: Source Sass files. Use this folder as a load path in Sass.
- `js/`: Source JavaScript files. If you're using a build system, make sure `foundation.core.js` is loaded first.
