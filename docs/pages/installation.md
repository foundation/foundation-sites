### Command-Line Tool

Not a fan of GUIs? The Node-powered Foundation CLI can install the same template projects for you. Install it with npm:

```bash
npm install --global foundation-cli
```

Depending on how your machine is configured, the command may fail with an `EACCESS` error. To get around this, run the command with `sudo` at the beginning:

```bash
sudo npm install --global foundation-cli
```

<div class="callout alert">
  <p>If you already have the Foundation 5 CLI on your machine, you will only be able to access one of the commands, depending on how your command line environment is configured.</p>

  <p>If you want to remove the old CLI, run <code>gem uninstall foundation</code>. After testing this new CLI, if you want to go back to the old CLI, run <code>npm uninstall foundation-cli --global</code>.</p>
</div>

Once you've installed the CLI, use the `new` command to start making a new project:

```bash
foundation new
```

## Manual Setup

### Basic Template

To manually set up the basic template, first download it with Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zurb/foundation-sites-template projectname
```

Then open the folder in your command line, and install the needed dependencies:

```bash
cd projectname
npm install
bower install
```

Finally, run `npm start` to run the Sass compiler. It will re-run every time you save a Sass file.

### ZURB Template

To manually set up the ZURB template, first download it with Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zurb/foundation-zurb-template projectname
```

Then open the folder in your command line, and install the needed dependencies:

```bash
cd projectname
npm install
bower install
```

Finally, run `npm start` to run Gulp. Your finished site will be created in a folder called `dist`, viewable at this URL:

```
http://localhost:8000
```

To create compressed, production-ready assets, run `npm run build`.

## CSS Download

  <a id="docs-mobile-video-link" class="docs-mobile-video" target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/lFrpnk0Oo_8"></a>
</div>

If you aren't into Sass, we have a starter template with compiled CSS and JavaScript, as well as a starting `index.html` file for you to hack on. Just unzip and get coding!

## HTML Starter Template
Start with this HTML template and adapt it to your needs. Be sure to include the `.no-js` class on the `html` tag of your template.  Adding this class prevents [flash of unstyled content](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_of_unstyled_content) for a number of foundation components.

```html
<!doctype html>
<html class="no-js" lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <meta http-equiv="x-ua-compatible" content="ie=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Foundation Starter Template</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/foundation.css" />
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello, world!</h1>

    <script src="js/vendor/jquery.js"></script>
    <script src="js/vendor/what-input.js"></script>
    <script src="js/vendor/foundation.min.js"></script>
    <script>
      $(document).foundation();
    </script>

  </body>
</html>

```

## CDN Links

The folks at [cdnjs](https://cdnjs.com) host the compressed Foundation CSS and JavaScript for us. Just drop one of these `<script>` tags into your HTML and you're set:

```html
<!-- Compressed CSS -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/foundation/6.4.1/css/foundation.min.css" integrity="sha256-itWEYdFWzZPBG78bJOOiQIn06QCgN/F0wMDcC4nOhxY=" crossorigin="anonymous" />

<!-- Compressed JavaScript -->
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/foundation/6.4.1/js/foundation.min.js" integrity="sha256-Nd2xznOkrE9HkrAMi4xWy/hXkQraXioBg9iYsBrcFrs=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
