Description:
    Setup Foundation assets in your app and generate new layouts preconfigured to use Foundation

Example:
  rails g foundation:install

  This will insert foundation require lines into default application assets:
    /app/assets/javascripts/application.js
    /app/assets/stylesheets/application.css

  And create sample layout (depending of your template engine):
    /app/views/layouts/application.html.erb

  And foundation variables override file:
    /app/assets/stylesheets/foundation_and_overrides.scss
