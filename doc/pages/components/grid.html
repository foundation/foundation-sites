# Grid

<h3 class="subheader">Create powerful multi-device layouts quickly and easily with the default 12-column, nest-able Foundation grid. If you're familiar with grid systems, you'll feel right at home. If not, you'll learn quickly.</h3>

***

<h3>Basic</h3>

Start by adding an element with a class of `row`. This will create a horizontal block to contain vertical columns. Then add divs with a `column` class within that row. You can use `column` or `columns` - the only difference is grammar. Specify the widths of each column with the small-#, medium-#, and large-# classes.

**Foundation is mobile-first**. Code for small screens first, and larger devices will inherit those styles. Customize for larger screens as necessary.

### Small Grid

Small grids expand to large screens easier than large grids cram into small screens.

***

### Medium Grid

Medium sized screens will inherit styles from small, unless you specify a different layout, using the medium grid classes.

<h3>Advanced</h3>

You can nest the grids indefinitely, though at a certain point it will get absurd.

### Offsets

Move blocks up to 11 columns to the right by using classes like `.large-offset-1` and `.small-offset-3`.

### Incomplete Rows

In order to work around browsers' different rounding behaviors, Foundation will float the last column in a row to the right so the edge aligns. If your row doesn't have a count that adds up to 12 columns, you can tag the last column with a class of `end` in order to override that behavior.

### Centered Columns

Center your columns by adding a class of `small-centered` to your `column`. Large will inherit small centering by default, but you can also center solely on large by applying a `large-centered` class. To uncenter on large screens use `large-uncentered`.

### Source Ordering

Using these source ordering classes, you can shift columns around between our breakpoints. This means if you place sub-navigation below main content on small displays, you have the option to position the sub-navigation on either the left or right of the page for large displays. Prefix push/pull with the size of the device you want to apply the styles to. `medium-push-#`, `large-push-#` is the syntax you'll use. Use `large-reset-order` to reset pushed or pulled columns to their original position on large screens.

## Customize with Sass

Customizing the grid is easy with the Sass variables provided in the `_settings.scss` file.

<h4>SCSS</h4>

{{> examples_grid_variables}}

<h3>Basic</h3>

You can use the `grid-row()` and `grid-column()` mixins to create your own rows and columns with semantic markup, like so:

<div class="row">
  <div class="large-6 columns">
    <h4>SCSS</h4>
{{#markdown}}
```scss
.custom-row-class {
  @include grid-row();
  .custom-column-class {
    @include grid-column(12);
  }
}
```
{{/markdown}}
  </div>
  <div class="large-6 columns">
    <h4>HTML</h4>
{{> examples_grid_row_mixin}}
  </div>
</div>

<h3>Advanced</h3>

You can further customize your grid columns using the provided options in the `grid-column()` mixin:

##### Row Mixin Options

<h4>SCSS</h4>

{{> examples_grid_row_options}}

##### Column Mixin Options

<h4>SCSS</h4>

{{> examples_grid_column_mixin}}

##### Placeholders

You can @extend placeholders to avoid duplicating code:

<h4>SCSS</h4>

{{> examples_grid_placeholders}}

***

##### Sass Errors?

If the default "foundation" import was commented out, then make sure you import this file:

<h4>SCSS</h4>

{{#markdown}}
```scss
@import "foundation/components/grid";
```
{{/markdown}}
