# Abide

<h3 class="subheader">Abide is an HTML5 form validation library that supports the native API by using patterns and required attributes.</h3>

***

## Setting Up Validation

To enable validation with Abide, add the `data-abide` attribute to your `form` element. Then add the `required` attribute to each input that you want to require. Additionaly, you can define a `pattern` to define restraints on what users can input.

{{> examples_abide_basic_rendered}}

***

## Predefined Patterns

Abide has several patterns common validation patterns built into the library:

{{> examples_abide_patterns}}

You can also use these patterns by setting the input's type to the name of the pattern instead of using the pattern attribute:

{{#markdown}}
```html
<input type="password" required>
<input type="email">
<input type="url">
```
{{/markdown}}

There is a good list of valid HTML5 input types on the [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Input). Try avoiding patterns defined by type that do not match the specification.

You can use the following shortcut for named patterns that aren't valid input types:

{{#markdown}}
```html
<input type="text" pattern="integer">
```
{{/markdown}}

***

## Custom Named Patterns

By overriding Abide during Foundation initilization, you can define your own custom patterns or override the default patterns to validate against.

{{> examples_abide_custom_patterns}}

You can then use these custom patterns like you would the predfined patterns in your markup:

{{> examples_abide_custom_patterns_rendered}}

***

## Error Messages

To display an error message for your invalid form element, include a `small` tag with an `error` class as a sibling of your input.

{{> examples_abide_errors}}

We have wrapped our input in a div in the example above. This div will receive an `error` class when the input is invalid. This class will show our error message and style the label and input accordingly.

Invalid inputs inherit a `data-invalid` attribute.

***

## Events

If a submit event is fired, a `valid` event is triggered when the form is valid and an `invalid` event is triggered when the form is invalid.

You can bind to these events and fire your own callback:

{{> examples_abide_events}}

***

## Using the JavaScript

<div class="panel">
  {{!-- TODO FIX JAVASCRIPT PATH --}}
  Before you can use Abide you'll want to verify that jQuery and `foundation.js` are available on your page. You can refer to the [JavaScript documentation](../JavaScript.html) on setting that up.
</div>

Just add `foundation.abide.js` AFTER the `foundation.js` file. Your markup should look something like this:

{{> examples_javascript}}

Required Foundation Library: `foundation.abide.js`

### Optional JavaScript Configuration

{{> examples_abide_javascript_options}}

***

### Sass Errors?

If the default "foundation" import was commented out, then make sure you import this file:

<h4>SCSS</h4>

{{#markdown}}
```scss
@import "foundation/components/abide";
```
{{/markdown}}
