<h3 class="subheader">Right-to-left text direction support in Foundation allows you to easily switch text direction for all components.</h3>

***

## Setup

Foundation was built to support right-to-left text direction out of the box, but you'll need to make a couple of adjustments to your markup and Sass to get everything up and running.

### Markup Changes for Right-to-Left Languages

You'll need to make a few changes to your markup to get the Javascript components working nice and smooth. In the `html` tag, you'll need to add a `dir` attribute with a value of `rtl`. Here's what your `html` tag should look like:

<h4>HTML</h4>

{{> examples_rtl_markup}}

### Change the Language Too

You'll need to change your `lang` attribute value to match your language. Here's a handy list of common right-to-left languages and their html codes:

* Arabic: ar
* Chinese: zh
* Farsi: fa
* Hebrew: he, iw
* Japanese: ja
* Urdu: ur
* Yiddish: yi, ji

### A Single Sass Adjustment

We made it really easy to switch the entire Foundation grid to right-to-left by changing the `$text-direction` Sass variable. Here's what the variable should look like:

#### Sass

{{> examples_rtl_sass}}

By changing this single variable, the entire grid and all the Foundation components will be switched to right-to-left orientation.

  #### Using CSS

  If you prefer vanilla CSS, use the customizer to download Foundation and get right-to-left support. Your download should be ready to use without any of the steps mentioned above.
