<h3>Basic</h3>

You can create an accordion using minimal markup like so:

<div class="row">
  <div class="large-6 columns">
    <h4>HTML</h4>
{{#markdown}}
```html
{{> examples_accordion_basic}}
```
{{/markdown}}
  </div>
  <div class="large-6 columns">
    <h4>Rendered HTML</h4>
    {{> examples_accordion_basic}}
  </div>
</div>

***

<h3>Distributed accordion groups</h3>

You can name the accordion so that it can be spread across different parent containers.  In this example the accordion is named *myAccordionGroup* and it is split between different columns in a block grid.  This allows the accordion to be responsive to screen width.

<div class="row">
  <div class="large-6 columns">
    <h4>HTML</h4>
{{#markdown}}
```html
{{> examples_accordion_grid}}
```
{{/markdown}}
  </div>
  <div class="large-6 columns">
    <h4>Rendered HTML</h4>
    {{> examples_accordion_grid}}
  </div>
</div>

## Customize With Sass

Accordions can be easily customized with the Sass variables provided in the `_settings.scss` file.

## Configure With Javascript

It's easy to configure dropdowns using our provided Javascript. You can use data-attributes or plain old Javascript. Make sure `jquery.js`, `foundation.js` and `foundation.accordion.js` have been included on your page before continuing. For example, add the following before the closing `<body>` tag:

{{#markdown}}
  ```html
<script src="js/vendor/jquery.js"></script>
<script src="js/foundation/foundation.js"></script>
<script src="js/foundation/foundation.accordion.js"></script>
  ```
{{/markdown}}

### Optional Javascript Configuration

#### JS

{{#markdown}}
```js
$(document).foundation({
  accordion: {
    // specify the class used for active (or open) accordion panels
    active_class: 'active',
    // allow multiple accordion panels to be active at the same time
    multi_expand: false,
    // allow accordion panels to be closed by clicking on their headers
    // setting to false only closes accordion panels when another is opened
    toggleable: true
  }
});
```
{{/markdown}}

***

##### Sass Errors?

If the default "foundation" import was commented out, then make sure you import this file:

<h4>SCSS</h4>

```scss
@import "foundation/components/accordion";
```
