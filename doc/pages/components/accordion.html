<h3>Basic</h3>

You can create an accordion using minimal markup like so:

<div class="row">
  <div class="large-6 columns">
    <h4>HTML</h4>
{{#markdown}}
```html
{{> examples_accordion_basic}}
```
{{/markdown}}
  </div>
  <div class="large-6 columns">
    <h4>Rendered HTML</h4>
    {{> examples_accordion_basic}}
  </div>
</div>

***

## Customize With Sass

Accordions can be easily customized with the Sass variables provided in the `_settings.scss` file.

<h4>SCSS</h4>

{{> examples_accordion_variables}}

***

##### Sass Errors?

If the default "foundation" import was commented out, then make sure you import this file:

<h4>SCSS</h4>

```scss
@import "foundation/components/accordion";
```
