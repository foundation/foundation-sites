# Forms

<h3 class="subheader">We set out to create an easy, powerful and versatile form layout system. A combination of form styles and the Foundation grid means you can do almost anything.</h3>

## Building Forms With HTML

Creating a form in Foundation is designed to be easy but extremely flexible. Forms are built with a combination of standard form elements, as well as the Grid (rows and columns).

Form elements in Foundation are styled based on their type attribute rather than a class, and can be sized in a couple of ways:

* You can size inputs using column sizes, like `.large-6`, `.small-6`.
* You can create row elements inside your form and use columns for the form, including inputs, labels and more. Rows inside a form inherit some special padding to even up input spacing.

This is an example form we've created that is laid out using the grid:

<div class="row">
  <div class="large-6 columns">
    <h4>HTML</h4>

{{> examples_form_basic_rendered}}
  </div>

  <div class="large-6 columns">
    <h4>Rendered HTML</h4>

{{> examples_form_basic}}
  </div>
</div>

### Inline Labels

Sometimes you want a form with labels to the left of your inputs. Piece of cake. You can put the label inside a different column to the left of the input. Then add a class of `.right` to the label to have it align to the right.

<div class="row">
  <div class="large-6 columns">
    <h4>HTML</h4>
{{> examples_form_inline_labels_rendered}}
  </div>

  <div class="large-6 columns">
    <h4>Rendered HTML</h4>
{{> examples_form_inline_labels}}
  </div>
</div>

Adding a class of `.inline` will have it vertically center against an input. You can use one or both of these classes to accomplish the look you want.

<div class="row">
  <div class="large-6 columns">
    <h4>HTML</h4>
{{> examples_form_inline_rendered}}
  </div>

  <div class="large-6 columns">
    <h4>Rendered HTML</h4>
{{> examples_form_inline}}
  </div>
</div>

### Defining a Fieldset

We don't see them too much, but one of the useful form elements included with Foundation is `<fieldset>`. This is used as a wrapper right inside the form element. Right after you define a fieldset, you can include a legend title by using `<legend>`. Here's some HTML to help make copy paste.

<div class="row">
  <div class="large-6 columns">
    <h4>HTML</h4>
{{> examples_form_fieldset_rendered}}
  </div>

  <div class="large-6 columns">
    <h4>Rendered HTML</h4>
{{> examples_form_fieldset}}
  </div>
</div>

***

### Pre/Postfix Labels &amp; Actions

Foundation forms support actions tied to buttons, and prefix / postfix labels, through a versatile approach using special grid properties. Essentially you can use `<div class="row collapse">` to create label / action / input combinations. You use the Foundation columns to define the size of the pre/postfix `<span class="postfix">` or `<span class="prefix">`. Here are a few examples:

<div class="row">
  <div class="large-6 columns">
    <h4>HTML</h4>
{{> examples_form_labels_rendered}}
  </div>

  <div class="large-6 columns">
    <h4>Rendered HTML</h4>
{{> examples_form_labels}}
  </div>
</div>

You'll notice that on the last postfix element, we've included the class of `radius`. This adds the border radius on the appropriate edge depending on whether it's a prefix or a postfix element. You can even include buttons with these styles, just apply the `.button` as well as the pre/postfix class.

***

### Error States

Foundation includes error states for labels, inputs and messaging that you can have your app generate programatically. You can attach a class of `.error` either to the individual elements (label, input, small) or to a column/div.

<div class="row">
  <div class="large-6 columns">
    <h4>HTML</h4>
{{> examples_form_errors_rendered}}
  </div>

  <div class="large-6 columns">
    <h4>Rendered HTML</h4>
{{> examples_form_errors}}
  </div>
</div>

## Customize With Sass

Forms can be easily customized with our provided Sass variables.

## Semantic Markup With Sass

You can create your own forms using our Sass mixins.

<h3>Pre/Postfix Mixin</h3>

You can use the `prefix-postfix-base()` and `prefix()` mixin to create your own form, like so:

##### Base mixin

<div class="row">
  <div class="large-6 columns">
    <h4>SCSS</h4>
{{#markdown}}
```scss
.custom-prefix-class {
  @include prefix-postfix-base();
  @include grid-column(
    $columns:3,
    $float:left
  );
}

input[type="text"].custom-input-class {
  @include grid-column($columns:9);
}
```
{{/markdown}}
  </div>
  <div class="large-6 columns">
{{#markdown}}
```html
<form>
  <div class="row collapse">
    <span class="custom-prefix-class">Label</span>
    <input type="text" class="custom-input-class" placeholder="Value">
  </div>
</form>
```
{{/markdown}}
  </div>
</div>

##### Prefix &amp; Postfix Style Mixins

We use this mixin to create prefix label styles

<div class="row">
  <div class="large-6 columns">
    <h4>SCSS</h4>
{{#markdown}}
```scss
.custom-prefix-class {
  @include prefix-postfix-base();
  @include prefix(
    // Control the background color, which also effect the border and font color. Default:$input-prefix-bg (scale-color(#fff, $lightness: -5%))
    $bg: $input-prefix-bg,
    // Toggle position settings if prefix is a button. Default:false
    $is-button: false
  );
  @include grid-column($columns:3,$float:left);
}

input[type="text"].custom-input-class {
  @include grid-column($columns:9);
}
```
{{/markdown}}
  </div>
  <div class="large-6 columns">
    <h4>HTML</h4>
{{#markdown}}
```html
<form>
  <div class="row collapse">
    <span class="custom-prefix-class">Label</span>
    <input type="text" class="custom-input-class" placeholder="Value">
  </div>
</form>
```
{{/markdown}}
  </div>
</div>

### Sass Errors?

If the default "foundation" import was commented out, then make sure you import this file:

<h4>SCSS</h4>

```scss
@import "foundation/components/buttons";
@import "foundation/components/forms";
```
