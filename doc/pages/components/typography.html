# Typography

<h3 class="subheader">Typography in Foundation 5 is meant to make your life easier by providing clean, attractive, simple default styles for all of the most basic typographical elements.</h3>

***

### Headers

Foundation includes styles for all of the header elements that are balanced and based on a modular scale (though modular-scale is not a dependency of Foundation).

<div class="row">
  <div class="large-6 columns">
  <h4>HTML</h4>
  {{#markdown}}
  ```html
{{> examples_typography_basic}}
	```
	{{/markdown}}
  </div>
  <div class="large-6 columns">
  <h4>Rendered HTML</h4>
  	<div class="type-demo">
			{{> examples_typography_basic}}
		</div>
  </div>
</div>

***

### Subheaders

Lighten up your headers by adding a class of .subheader to any header element.

<div class="row">
  <div class="large-6 columns">
  <h4>HTML</h4>
  {{#markdown}}
  ```html
{{> examples_typography_subheader}}
	```
	{{/markdown}}
  </div>
  <div class="large-6 columns">
  <h4>Rendered HTML</h4>
  	<div class="type-demo">
			{{> examples_typography_subheader}}
		</div>
  </div>
</div>

***

### Small Header Segments

By inserting a `small` element into a header Foundation will scale the header font size down for an inline element, allowing you to use this for subtitles or other secondary header text.

<div class="row">
  <div class="large-6 columns">
  <h4>HTML</h4>
{{#markdown}}
```html
{{> examples_typography_small}}
```
{{/markdown}}
  </div>
  <div class="large-6 columns">
  <h4>Rendered HTML</h4>
  	<div class="type-demo">
			{{> examples_typography_small}}
		</div>
  </div>
</div>

***

### Paragraphs

This is a paragraph. Paragraphs are preset with a font size, line height and spacing to match the overall vertical rhythm. To show what a paragraph looks like this needs a little more content &#45;&#45; so, did you know that there are storms occurring on Jupiter that are larger than the Earth? Pretty cool. Wrap `strong` around type to **make it bold!** You can also use `em` to *italicize your words*.

<h4>HTML</h4>

{{#markdown}}
```html

### Links

Links are pretty standard  the [color is preset](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT2aVoUkSDg) to the Foundation primary color.

<h4>HTML</h4>

{{#markdown}}
```html
<p>Links are very standard, and the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT2aVoUkSDg">color is preset</a> to the Foundation primary color.</p>
```
{{/markdown}}

### Lists

Lists are helpful for, well, lists of things. Didn't see that coming did you! There are baked-in styles for a number of different unordered list styles, as well as ordered and definition lists.

### Blockquotes

Sometimes other people say smart things, and you may want to mention that through a blockquote callout. We've got you covered.

<div class="row">
  <div class="large-6 columns">
  <h4>HTML</h4>
{{#markdown}}
```html
<blockquote>Those people who think they know everything are a great annoyance to those of us who do.<cite>Isaac Asimov</cite></blockquote>
```
{{/markdown}}
  </div>
  <div class="large-6 columns">
  <h4>Rendered HTML</h4>
		<blockquote>Those people who think they know everything are a great annoyance to those of us who do.<cite>Isaac Asimov</cite></blockquote>
  </div>
</div>

### V-Cards

Here's a handy microformat-friendly list to *address* all your needs.


<div class="row">
  <div class="large-6 columns">
  <h4>HTML</h4>
{{#markdown}}
```html
{{> examples_typography_vcard}}
```
{{/markdown}}
  </div>
  <div class="large-6 columns">
  <h4>Rendered HTML</h4>
  	<div class="type-demo">
			{{> examples_typography_vcard}}
		</div>
  </div>
</div>

### Print Styles

Foundation includes print styles developed by HTML5 Boilerplate to give you some basic print-specific styles. These are activated when you print through a media query. It includes:

* Clearing out backgrounds, box shadows and text shadows
* Appending link URLs after the anchor text
* Bordering blockquotes and pre elements
* Page cleanup and window minimization

On top of that, Foundation includes a couple of simple classes you can use to control elements printing, or not printing. Simply attach `.show-for-print` to an element to only show when printing, and `.hide-for-print` to hide something when printing.

### Available SCSS Variables

We've got a ton of variables for you to use to customize your typography.

##### Sass Errors?

If the default "foundation" import was commented out, then make sure you import this file:

<h4>SCSS</h4>

{{#markdown}}
```scss
@import "foundation/components/type";
```
{{/markdown}}
