## Nested Headings

When nesting headings `<h1> - <h6>`, your primary document header should be an `<h1>`. Subsequent headings should make logical use of `<h2> - <h6>` such that screen readers can construct a table of contents for your pages.

##  How to Test a Website’s Keyboard Accessibility

On a desktop or laptop in Firefox, IE, Chrome, or Safari, 
click into the browser address bar.

Take your hand off your mouse and use only your keyboard.
Using the Tab button, navigate until you’ve reached the link below. (You can use Shift+Tab to navigate back one step.)

<ul>
	<li>Right arrow: Next navigation bar item</li>
	<li>Left arrow: Previous navigation bar item</li>
	<li>Enter: Activate currently focused item (i.e. navigate to corresponding URL)</li>
</ul>
