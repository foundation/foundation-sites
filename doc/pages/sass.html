# Getting Started With Sass

<h3 class="subheader">Sass is a superset of CSS that adds in amazing features such as variables, nested selectors and loops. It's also the easiest way to customize Foundation!</h3>

***

### System Requirements

Before proceeding, you'll want to install the following on your system:

  * Git
  * [Ruby 1.9+](https://www.ruby-lang.org/)
  * [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org)

Starting in Foundation 5, we've started using bower to manage the updating process of Foundation. It only needs to be installed one time using the following command:

<h4>Bash</h4>

```bash
[sudo] npm install -g bower grunt-cli
```

Then you can install our CLI using the following command:

<h4>Bash</h4>

```bash
gem install foundation
```

### Using Foundation With Grunt + Libsass

At ZURB, we prefer to run Foundation with using [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com) in conjunction with [Libsass](https://github.com/hcatlin/libsass), because it's the fastest way to compile your Sass stylesheets.

###### Create a New Project

First, navigate into the directory where you want to create your project.

```bash
cd path/to/sites
```

Next we'll use the Foundation CLI to create a new project:

```bash
foundation new project_name --libsass
```

Boom, your project is created! Now you need to use Grunt to compile everything before you start working. Run this command

```bash
grunt build
```



<div class="row">
  <div class="large-6 columns">
    <h4>New Project</h4>
{{#markdown}}

{{/markdown}}
  </div>
  <div class="large-6 columns">
    <h4>Updating Your Project</h4>
{{#markdown}}
```bash
cd MY_PROJECT
foundation update
```
{{/markdown}}
  </div>
</div>

***

### Using Foundation With Compass

[Compass](http://compass-style.org/) is the easiest way to get going with Sass. It can be installed with the following commands:

<div class="row">
  <div class="large-6 columns">
    <h4>New Project</h4>
{{#markdown}}
```bash
foundation new MY_PROJECT
```
{{/markdown}}
  </div>
  <div class="large-6 columns">
    <h4>Updating Your Project</h4>
{{#markdown}}
```bash
cd MY_PROJECT
foundation update
```
{{/markdown}}
  </div>
</div>

### Using Foundation with something else

If you prefer using Foundation with a tool that's not listed here, you may want to check out our [community](/develop/tools.html) page to see if there's a port for you.
