### Try Foundation in the Browser

Want to give Foundation a quick spin? We've set up a Codepen where you can play around with the default Foundation download &mdash; HTML, CSS and JS. Pretty swanky way to just see what Foundation has to offer.

### What Comes With Foundation?

Well, most everything you need, we hope. Foundation has a ton of components and structures to help you build a responsive site without having to worry about all of your baseline, foundational (see what we did there) code. Here's a snapshot of what every version of Foundation includes:

<div class="row">
  <div class="medium-6 columns">
    <h3><a href="{{relative absolute 'dist/docs/components/grid.html'}}"><strong>The Grid</strong></a></h3>
    <p>Our grid works on almost any device and has support for nesting, source ordering, offsets and device presentation. Frankly it's a little too easy.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="medium-6 columns">
    <h3><a href="{{relative absolute 'dist/docs/components/offcanvas.html'}}"><strong>Navigation</strong></a></h3>
    <p>People have to get around. Navigation styles in Foundation include a bitchin' off-canvas implementation, a robust top bar, and a bunch of other navigational constructs.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="row">
  <div class="medium-6 columns">
    <h3><a href="{{relative absolute 'dist/docs/components/buttons.html'}}"><strong>Buttons</strong></a></h3>
    <p>Clicking on stuff is awesome, so hook up your users with buttons to do stuff. We've included styles for size, presentation, color and more so making a button is as easy as adding a class.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="medium-6 columns">
    <h3><a href="{{relative absolute 'dist/docs/components/interchange.html'}}"><strong>Plugins</strong></a></h3>
    <p>We've included a ton of JS plugins written just for Foundation to optimize your page (Interchange), show off images (Clearing), pop up modals (Reveal) and tons more.</p>
  </div>
</div>

###...and so much more. Seriously.

That's just a snapshot of everything in Foundation. Check out all the components here through the docs &mdash; there are explanations, code examples, rendered examples and everything you need to build the components in Foundation with HTML, CSS, or Sass. Go forth and make awesome things.
