Foundation is the most advanced responsive front-end framework in the world. You can quickly prototype and build sites or apps that work on any kind of device with Foundation, which includes layout constructs (like a fully responsive grid), elements and best practices.

To get started, check out <http://foundation.zurb.com/docs>


## Quickstart

To get going with Foundation you can:

  * [Download the latest release](http://foundation.zurb.com/cdn/releases/foundation-latest.zip)
  * [Install with Bower](http://bower.io): `bower install zurb/bower-foundation`

## Documentation

Foundation uses [Assemble.io](http://assemble.io) and [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) to generate its [documentation pages](http://foundation.zurb.com/docs). Documentation can also be run from your local computer:
