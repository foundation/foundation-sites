Foundation is the most advanced responsive front-end framework in the world. Quickly go from prototype to production, building sites or apps that work on any kind of device with Foundation. Includes a fully customizable, responsive grid, a large library of Sass mixins, commonly used JavaScript plugins, and full accessibility support.

## Getting Started

The quickest way to get started is with the [basic CSS download](http://foundation.zurb.com/sites/download/). You can get versions with every component, essential ones only, or a custom build.

If you're a Sass user, we have two starter project templates, the [Basic Template](https://github.com/zurb/foundation-sites-template) and the [ZURB Template](https://github.com/zurb/foundation-zurb-template). You can install them by manually downloading them from GitHub, or using the [Foundation CLI](https://github.com/zurb/foundation-cli).

Lastly, if you're rolling your own setup, you can install Foundation through a variety of [package managers](http://foundation.zurb.com/sites/docs/installation.html#package-managers).

## Documentation

The documentation can be found at <https://foundation.zurb.com/sites/docs>. To run the documentation locally on your machine, you need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your computer. (Your Node.js version must be **4.0** or higher.)

Run these commands to set up the documentation:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zurb/foundation-sites
cd foundation-sites
npm install
```

Then run `npm start` to compile the documentation. When it finishes, a new browser window will open pointing to a BrowserSync server displaying the documentation.
