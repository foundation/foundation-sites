foundation + placeholders
=========================

Using the power of SASS' placeholders, it's even easier (and more efficient) to build responsive and semantic sites. 

No need to stuff your HTML with class="small-5 preffix-1" nor to repeat the same things over and over in your CSS after using too many @imports.
