# Adding a Building Block

## Pull down the gh-pages branch from the Foundation repo.
command - git clone -b gh-pages https://github.com/zurb/foundation.git

## Duplicate the index.html page. 
This is the standard page that comes with Foundation, which already has the stylesheets and JS attached. From here, build out your pattern. Make sure to take note of any additional styles and JS you include. 

## Commit your changes and push your page up to Github. 
If successful, you can preview the page with a URL that looks like this: zurb.github.io/foundation/pageName.html

## Add your code pattern on Pattern Tap. 
To do so, just hop on over to this page: http://patterntap.com/node/add/code (you may need to be an admin to access this page.

Details you'll need to fill in:
- Title: Be descriptive. "Rounded Button with Gradient" or "Simple Grid Layout with Masonry" is better than "Button" and "Layout"
- Image: For code patterns, we'll use abstract, white and gray images.  There is a template on Dropbox in Publishing --> ZURBexpo --> Pattern Tap --> code-ss.png
Example Source: The Github page URL. It should look like: zurb.github.io/foundation/pageName.html 
Code: 
- HTML - Anything you added within the <body> tag
- CSS/SCSS - Any additional styles you added on top of Foundation. If it's a template, just put "This pattern is unstyled."
- Javascript - Any JS you used. If you didn't add any, just put "This template does not require additional Javascript."

## Type: 
What you created, like "blog" or "layout." If you don't see a tag that matches what you've made, you'll need to add it by going to http://patterntap.com/#overlay=admin/structure/taxonomy and going to "Add Terms" in Code Type

## See it live! 
Your code pattern should show up immediately if you're an admin. If you're having trouble, feel free to reach out to me.
