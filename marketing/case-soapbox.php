            <h4 class="subheader">Rapidly launching and iterating for our audience.</h4>
            <p>ZURBsoapbox is a speaking series we host at ZURB HQ, where we invite influential entrepreneurs, designers, and other tech types to come and share their experiences.</p>
            <p>We launched <a href="http://www.zurbsoapbox.com">ZURBsoapbox</a>, the first site built with Foundation, in order to raise engagement and create a resource for anyone who can't attend in person. <strong>Here's some of the highlights.</strong></p>

            <h4>Instant Mobile Site</h4>
            <p>Thanks to Foundation's <a href="docs/grid.php">built-in responsive grid</a>, as soon as we put together the desktop prototype we already had a working mobile prototype, ready for tablets, phones and other devices.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="row">
          <div class="six columns push-six">
            <h4>Device-Specific Function</h4>
            <p>Mobile devices can't handle our standard flash audio player, so we used <a href="docs/elements.php">Foundation's mobile visibility classes</a> to selectively hide the flash element, and show a mobile-friendly audio file link.</p>

            <h4>Next Steps: Images</h4>
            <p>We practice what we preach, and we're always iterating on Foundation-based sites. Our next step is to implement a more mobile-friendly image solution, so devices don't have to load quite as much data. There's a lot of good work going on in this area, but also a lot to figure out.</p>
