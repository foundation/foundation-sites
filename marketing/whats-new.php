        <h3>Developed in Sass</h3>
        <h5 class="subheader">One of the biggest changes for Foundation 3 was that we've shifted development of the framework to <a href="http://www.sass-lang.com" alt="Sass">Sass</a> and <a href="http://www.compass-style.org" alt="Compass">Compass</a> rather than pure CSS.</h5>
        <p>We took our time arriving at this approach, evaluating the different preprocessors out there. In the end, we determined that Sass provided the most robust tool for our development. Sass provides us with variables, functions and powerful mixins that really speed up our development of the framework, as well as make the code much more concise.</p>
        <p>It was important to us to not leave our vanilla CSS fans behind, so we've made it really easy to customize and download Foundation to fit your needs. You can change colors, font sizes, grid specs and more!</p>

        <h3>Feature Complete!</h3>
        <h5 class="subheader">This means we've got all the UI elements and tools you could image. You have access to everything from buttons with dropdowns, to simple keystroke characters, to advanced semantic grid systems.</h5>
        <p>Take a scroll and some clicks through our documentation and you'll quickly see how much awesomess you have at your fingertips. Building a prototype or production site has never been easier. With Foundation 3, you'll be working more efficiently towards your web development goals.</p>
        <p>Sure, other frameworks have the same elements, but within Foundation these become more than a styleguide. You have complete control to easily override base Foundation styles and make your web project shine so bright they could melt the Yeti.</p>

        <h3>Freakishly Advanced</h3>
        <h5 class="subheader">Foundation 3 is cutting-edge, pulling in some of the best, newest approaches to front-end development so that you're armed for an evolving future online.</h5>
        <p>We're using <strong>box-sizing: border-box</strong> on the entire framework, meaning padding and sizing is much simpler and more flexible. The framework core uses no images at all, relying entirely on resolution-independent elements like CSS shapes or unicode. (To be fair, Orbit still has some included images. We'll get there.)</p>
        <p>Advanced CSS is one thing, but we also wanted to push the envelope in Sass. We're using a modular scale for our typography that is based on ratios and numbers of your choice!. We're also using Sass' invisible classes to streamline our development.</p>
        <p>Foundation 3 is also now right at the forefront of Web development best practices, with an included semantic grid system. If the presentational nature of CSS-based grid systems gets you down and you want to remove all those columns and rows from your markup, we've got you covered with a very robust set of Sass mixins to attach row and column styles to any element you choose.
