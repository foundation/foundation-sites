				<h3>Welcome to Foundation!</h3>
				<h4 class="subheader">Welcome to the Foundation documentation. Here you can learn what Foundation includes, as well as how to use it on mobile and on the desktop Web.</h4>

				<h4>What's in Foundation?</h4>
				<p>So much good stuff, girl. We've built Foundation to help you quickly get a site off the ground and to a state where you can easily adapt and modify it into a release. Here's the highlights:</p>
				<div class="row">
					<div class="six columns">
						<ul>
							<li><h5>Global</h5> Foundation's global styles include Eric Meyer's rock-solid reset, tested styles for typography, links, lists, tables and more.</li>
							<li><h5><a href="grid.php">The Grid</a></h5> You're gonna like this. Within global.css you'll find The Grid (not the one from Tron), a layout framework that works on mobile devices, small screens and full-on modern desktops. It's a twelve column, semi-liquid, mobile-scaling grid of awesomeness that you're gonna love. It even supports arbitrary nesting.</li>
							<li><h5><a href="buttons.php">Buttons</a></h5> We love buttons at ZURB. Foundation includes two base styles, three sizes, and several colors that are preconfigured and super easy to modify.</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
					<div class="six columns">
						<ul>
							<li><h5><a href="forms.php">Forms</a></h5> Hate forms? So do we. They're a pain. Well, we're simplifying that by creating two base styles for forms that are tested, include validation styles, have proper spacing&hellip;all the good stuff. We even included custom radio buttons, checkboxes and select lists so you can style up every form element. They're easy to modify, like everything else.</li>
							<li><h5><a href="orbit.php">Orbit</a></h5> That's right - Orbit, the awesome way to put image or content sliders on your page, is packaged in with Foundation. It even works on mobile.</li>
							<li><h5><a href="reveal.php">Reveal</a></h5> Finally, we've created a whole new plugin for modal dialogs in Foundation. Reveal is easy to call, supports several intro animations right out of the box, and is completely stylable. It also works on mobile.</li>
						</ul>
					</div>

				<h4>What's Next for Foundation</h4>
				<p>We're not content to sit still &mdash; we're going to keep polishing Foundation, fixing edge cases, and preparing for the next major release. Coming to Foundation: templates, site generation, more common elements, and even better mobile support.</p>

				<h4>Contributing to Foundation</h4>
				<p>Foundation is <a href="https://github.com/zurb/foundation">hosted on Github</a>. If you have questions or bugs please file them through Github, but you can also <a href="mailto:jonathan+foundation@zurb.com">talk to us</a> if you want to get into Foundation and help build out the next generation way of rapidly prototyping. Yeah, we're thinking big.</p>
